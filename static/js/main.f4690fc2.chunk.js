To make the dough mix together semolina and warm water. Make a very wet dough as semolina will absorb water and become stiff. When making the dough you don\u2019t have to kneed a lot. Cover the dough with damp cloth and give rest for 15min. Warm water is added so that the semolina readily blooms and softens. In the meantime prepare the stuffing by mixing together gram flour, semolina, baking soda and water. Keep the stuffing moist and soft just as the same consistency as the dough. Cover with a damp cloth and rest for 10min. Now knead the dough to mix it together so as to soften he dough. If the dough becomes too stiff then sprinkle some water to make it pliable. Divide the dough into equal size balls of about 10gms each. Cover with damp cloth and start mixing the stuffing and divide it into equal size balls of 3gms each. Make sure that the consistency of the dough and the stuffing is almost the same. Now lightly flatten and spread the dough ball with your fingers and place the stuffing int he centre and gently roll the dough to a ball. This is just like stuffing a paratha. Do this for the entire dough and place them back under a damp cloth. Heat oil in a kadai to medium hot. Lightly oil the counter and the rolling pin (belan) and roll out the dough to make a thin disc about 3.5inches in diameter. While rolling make sure that the stuffing is evenly distributed. As the stuffing has the baking soda so the more evenly it spreads the more evenly it will puff up. Gently lift and slide into hot oil, pour hot oil on top using a frying spoon till it puffs. Turn over and cook on both sides till it turns light brown. Remove to an absorbent paper and let it rest. Leave it to rest for 2 hours for it to get crisp before you use it. Once crisp and cooled poke on one side and fill it up with the list of filling mentioned in the ingredients list above. Make sure to filling in and drop on to the plate extra yogurt, tamarind chutney and mint chutney.

Add in the ice over the ghee and begin to move around ice so that the ghee cools and starts to solidify. Make sure all of ghee solidifies again but remains soft. At this stage remove all the ice cubes and water. Using your fingers scrape and bring all the ghee on to one side of the utensil and squeeze it to remove any water. Now using the palm of your hand start rubbing the ghee to make it softer and creamy. Do this for 4-5mins till the ghee resembles like sift white butter. At this point begin adding the maida slowly in small batches and mix with the tips of your fingers. Once about half of the maida has been incorporated, it will begin resemble a texture like bread crumbs. At this point transfer the rest of the maida to the parat and incorporate using a similar technique. Rub the ghee and maida together to make it crumbly. Gradually add in the water slowly in small batches to avoid splashing and form a stable emulsion. Make sure as you add water you keep rubbing the batter with the palm of your hand to avoid any lumps Incorporate all of the water to warm an extremely thin batter and strain it though a sieve to avoid any lumps. The batter should be watery thin with light coating on the hands. Fill a heavy kadhai (about 12-15inches wide from the top) with oil to the middle and begin to heat. The oil should be medium to high hot before we add the batter. Fill the batter in a laddle and slowly drizzle it in the centre of the hot oil in one motion. Make sure to drop the batter from at least 10inches from the surface of the oil. Doing this step enables that the batter quickly disintegrates into tiny holes like pattern and run towards the outer side, making a web in the process. Add another laddle of the batter in the centre again and keep repeating till you get a solid mass covering the kadai. Make sure that each time you add batter the temperature of the oil should be med - high. Once it reaches the desired size let it brown lightly and then using a handle of a wooden laddle lift the ghewar out and hold it out of the oil over the kadai to drain excess oil. Place it gently over a ring cutter or a cup to drain all the oil. Once it cools completely place it on to a try for toppings. FOR SUGAR SYRUP Mix together sugar, water and cardamom powder and bring to a boil. Cook till sugar dissolves and we get a thick single string consistency. Remove from heat and let it cool completely. FOR RABRI Heat milk in a pan and bring to a boil and let it simmer. Cook the milk till it reduces to \xbc of the original quantity of milk. Make sure to stir the milk constantly during the process of reducing the milk and also keep scrapping the sides. Once it reduces to \xbcth add sugar and cardamom powder, stir till sugar dissolves and remove it from heat to cool. Rabri is ready. ASSEMBLING THE GHEWAR - FOR PLAIN GHEWAR For plain ghewar pour some sugar syrup over the ghewar and garnish it with some chopped nuts. Let it sit for 15mins, remove to a platter and serve.
